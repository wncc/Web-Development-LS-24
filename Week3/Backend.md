# Week 3: Introduction to Back-End Development with Django

Hey everyone,

We hope you've enjoyed the course so far and are excited to delve deeper into Web Development. Your assignments from last week were truly impressive, and we look forward to seeing the same level of enthusiasm and dedication as we progress.

This week, we’ll begin exploring the back end of Web Development. As you know there are many frameworks for the same, we have decided to use the most popular one: Django framework. Since Django is primarily based on Python, we’ll start with a brief overview of the language. Mastering Python is crucial, as its applications extend well beyond web development.

If you're already familiar with the basics of Python, feel free to dive straight into the Django tutorials. If you're new to Python or need a refresher, we've curated some excellent resources to help you build a solid foundation. Let's get started and keep up the great work!

## Python resources:

You just need to know the basic syntax of the python language for Django. Since you have already studied Javascript, you know all the fundamentals for a programming language. Here are the topics you need to see in Python for Django :

- Variables , Data Types ,Operators in Python , Input/Output ,Importing Modules

- If/Else and other conditionals

- Move on to loops

- Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries (Basic understanding)

- Basic functions using variables

- Classes , attributes and functions inside classes.

Now that we know the role of Back-end, let's get on with designing your own Back-end with Django.

## Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

Django works on [MVT architecture](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/getting-started-django-tutorial#django-architecture) which is a variant of MVC (Model-View-Controller).

## Setting up Django:



- **Website: [Installation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/install/#installing-an-official-release-with-pip) (For Python Projects it is advised to use a virtual environment so do follow the same : [Virtual Environment](https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_create_virtual_environment.php))**

- **Alternatives : [Installation Video](https://youtu.be/s_79O4zwCZg?si=6L6ytsXkTpazH5tS) (Pycharm) and [Installation](https://youtu.be/PtQiiknWUcI?t=959&feature=shared)**



## Websites to follow (any one):



- **[Official Website](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/) (as always official docs are the best resource to use and trust us Django’s official documentation is really good)**

- **[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/) (as usual these are alternatives which you can follow if you got any doubts)**

- **[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-basic-project-using-mvt-in-django/?ref=lbp)**
